1. Creating and Renaming Files/Directories
Create a directory named test_dir using mkdir	#mkdir test_dir
Inside test_dir, create an empty file called example.txt.	#touch example.txt
Rename example.txt to renamed_example.txt using mv	#mv example.txt renamed_example.txt


2. Viewing File Contents
Use cat to display the contents of /etc/passwd. 	#cat /etc/passwd
Display only the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd using head.	#head -n 5 /etc/passwd
Display only the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd using tail.	#tail -n 5 /etc/passwd

3.Searching for Patterns
Use grep to find all lines containing the word "root" in /etc/passwd.	#grep "root" /etc/passwd


4. Zipping and Unzipping
Compress the test_dir directory into a file named test_dir.zip using zip.	#zip -r test_dir.zip test_dir
Unzip test_dir.zip into a new directory named unzipped_dir.	#mkdir unzipped_dir	#unzip test_dir.zip -d unzipped_dir


5. Downloading Files
Use wget to download a file from a URL (e.g., https://example.com/sample.txt).	#wget https://example.com/sample.txt(will download sample.txt)

6. Changing Permissions
Create a file named secure.txt and change its permissions to read-only for everyone using chmod.	#touch secure.txt # chmod 444 secure.txt(will convert file to read-only)

7. Working with Environment Variables
Use export to set a new environment variable called MY_VAR with the value "Hello, Linux!".	#export MY_VAR="Hello, Linux!" 	#echo $MY_VAR
